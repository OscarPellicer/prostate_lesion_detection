# CHANGELOG:
#
# load_saved_predictions had to be modified for the prostate cancer detection problem
# as it was not producing the correct results.
# predict_test_set also was modified: a new parameter, `n_test_plots` was added to
# configure the number of test plots to produce. Also now raw segmentations are saved in
# dict_of_patient_results, and then they are later averaged over the ensemble.
# All these changes have not been tested with other kinds of problems though 
# (e.g.: 2D or 2.5D CNNs, image patches)

    example: a cluster of predictions was found overlap > iou thresh in xy (like NMS). The z-coordinate of the highest
