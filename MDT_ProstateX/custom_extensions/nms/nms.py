def nms(boxes, scores, iou_threshold):
    """
    Performs non-maximum suppression (NMS) on the boxes according
    to their intersection-over-union (IoU).

    NMS iteratively removes lower scoring boxes which have an
    IoU greater than iou_threshold with another (higher scoring)
    box.

    Parameters
    ----------
    boxes : Tensor[N, 4] for 2D or Tensor[N,6] for 3D.
        boxes to perform NMS on. They
        are expected to be in (y1, x1, y2, x2(, z1, z2)) format
    scores : Tensor[N]
        scores for each one of the boxes
    iou_threshold : float
        discards all overlapping
        boxes with IoU < iou_threshold

    Returns
    -------
    keep : Tensor
        int64 tensor with the indices
        of the elements that have been kept
        by NMS, sorted in decreasing order of scores

    Performs non-maximum suppression in a batched fashion.

    Each index value correspond to a category, and NMS
    will not be applied between elements of different categories.

    Parameters
    ----------
    boxes : Tensor[N, 4] for 2D or Tensor[N,6] for 3D.
        boxes to perform NMS on. They
        are expected to be in (y1, x1, y2, x2(, z1, z2)) format
    scores : Tensor[N]
        scores for each one of the boxes
    idxs : Tensor[N]
        indices of the categories for each one of the boxes.
    iou_threshold : float
        discards all overlapping boxes
        with IoU < iou_threshold

    -------
    keep : Tensor
        int64 tensor with the indices of
        the elements that have been kept by NMS, sorted
